# **Instructions**

* Implement the logic for the CLI component. Refer to the architectural diagram for help.

* Before you write any JavaScript, write out the CLI component's behavior in pseudocode.

* **Hint**: This component doesn't require much code.

* **Hint**: This component _does_ require components you haven't written, yet. This is fine. For now, just use `null`/`undefined` or a string as a placeholder.

* When you're finished, ask the instructor or one of your TAs to approve your solution. If you finish early, feel free to begin on the `UserSearch` component.
