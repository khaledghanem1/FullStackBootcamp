### Statement of completion

Be subjective, grading & feedback should not take more than 5 minutes per assignment.

The deployed assignment utilizes Javascript to read user's input on the keyboard, and compare it to the letters in a word. It displays letters guessed correctly and incorrectly. It notifies the user whether they've won or lost at the end of the game.

**Is the above statement correct?**

1. **Yes**: Grade will be an A or a B

2. **No**: Grade will be a C

3. **No idea, can't test**: Grade will be a D or F

### Yes (A or B)

If the student's assignment was pristine, give them an A, and an encouraging sentence for feedback.

If the student's assignment had a few areas for improvement, give them a B, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback.

### No (C)

Give the student a C, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### No idea (D or F)

If the project isn't deployed, the student receives a D.

If the student turned in nothing, the student receives an F.

Either way, explain to the student why they received that grade, and invite them to visit office hours for help.
